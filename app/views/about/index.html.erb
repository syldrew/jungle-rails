        <h1>Welcome to Jungle!</h1>
        <p> Our founders started out as a group of childhood friends that all had a passion for nature and the outdoors.  Unfortunately, they found it difficult to find a place online to purchase houseplants that was easy to navigate and wasnâ€™t just geared to wholesale. So, in 2020, they decided to launch Jungle to be the ultimate destination for everything houseplants.
